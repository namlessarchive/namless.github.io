          <div class="contentText">
            <p>Nameless is a 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons campaign created in early 2023, with some elements and early sessions dating back to 2022. It stars a cast of four player characters. Talesin, Silva, Namdu and Trenil. The plot consists of the group’s strenuous adventures to defeat the Splendid Beasts. With help from the fair and beautiful <a href="goddess.html">Goddess of Light</a>, they hope to stand tall and save the Nameless World.

		<h1>The Campaign</h1>
		<div class="contentText">
		  There is only day. Night died a long time ago. Magic is a rarity, only given as a gift from the gods, but do the gods even exist? The world is dying but that’s no reason to throw away your dignity. Maybe, just maybe, if you leave a big enough impact, you’ll be remembered. By who is a different matter</p><br />
          <p>Nobody has to die. In this story, you may find yourselves talking more than fighting. Of course, one should always find themselves ready to fight in a desperate, dying land.</p></div>
		<h1>Session 0</h1>
		<div class="contentText">
		This world is peaceful. Its inhabitants kind. However, otherworldly interlopers descended upon humanity and mankind became fleeting. Rising from their ashes, an incurable disease plagues what remains. Though desolate, all is not lost. Humanity, stubborn and persevering, still trudges on.The setting aims to be a dark, low fantasy. The story and world will also be on a small scale. For comparison's sake, think of it similar to "Thaumaturgy," a story where you have your goal in a small, but densely filled world. Realize that the world is its own being from you. Know that you are but a single part of the world. Not to say your freedom is limited, but the opposite. See it as an exercise in absurdism: you are welcome to do whatever you want, just know that you will have to bear the consequences, too. Narration will be told through conventional wisdom, rather through objectivity. That is to say, the DM will narrate in accordance with whatever is most believed in the world, even if that belief may not be completely factual. Expect a heavy focus on roleplay. Not to say there is less importance to combat; combat just becomes a means to an end. Please have fun. You are the heroes.
