	<h1>Brief</h1>
     You are all recently graduated pilots, or re-instated ones, regardless you have been assigned to your first mission. You have been transferred to the Ebro-class light carrier ship named the <b>“Rio Grande”</b>. This ship has been in orbit around the planet Cressidum. On the planet, 500 years of growth have spawned large nations, including the <b>Leandric States Alliance (LSA)</b>, the <b>Vestan Sovereignty</b>, and the Republic of Okasnia. The current ship orders of the Rio Grande are to oversee the <b>LSA</b>, who have been fighting against the oppressive SecComm remnants, <b>The Sovereignty</b>.  Socially, Cessidum is an isolationist state, and while tensions are high between the <b>LSA</b> and <b>The Sovereignty</b>, at this moment, it is not to the point of war.</br></br>
	 Union has held diplomatic talks with Cressidum, specifically with the <b>LSA</b>, who have been offered access to new printing tech they have not been able to develop. Along with numerous societal benefits. <b>The Sovereginty</b> however, is not interested and swears by it’s rule. Our goal is to change this fact, through one means or another.
