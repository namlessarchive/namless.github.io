	<h1>The Planet Cradle.</h1>
    <b>Cradle is Union’s homeworld, the planet we once call Earth.</b></br></br> Cradle is highly developed, densely populated, and dedicated to the daily maintenance,planning, and operations of Union. Humanity's ancestral homeworld is the beating heart of the galactic hegemon: part memorial, part privileged residence, part central hub.

	<h1>The People.</h1>
	The people of Cradle refer to themselves primarily as humans, Terrans, or – less commonly – Solars or Gaians. When speaking of their home, they refer simply to Cradle, or to the planet, station, or moon they call home. </br></br>The Sol system – often interchangeably called Cradle as well – is also home to a massive transient population of Cosmopolitans and Diasporans engaged in trade, diplomatic, scientific, and religious missions to and from the rest of the galaxy.

    <div class="section">
	<h1>Pre-fall.</h1>
    <p>Before the Fall, Old Humanity ravaged the world: even as those who came before cracked the wonders of the universe, they grew a cancer in the heart of the world that nearly scoured all life from its surface. These times are refered to as BU, (I.E, before 0U). Not much about this time is known, history of this point is very lost. The planet, refered to as "Earth" at this time as experiencing degradation. Both within it’s environment and leadership. Confirmed space travel records show that old humanity had managed to colonize mars, and housed large orbital space stations.</p>
	<h2>The Ten.</h2>
	<p>A large scale inter-system space project launches. in 6000bu, (approximated 6000 years before Union.) <b>APOLLO</b> is the first of 10 massive generation ships sent out to search for inhabitable planets.</br></br>In 5800bu, <b>APOLLO</b> confirms landfall and existence of a planet now dubbed Karrakis. Upon the message reaching Cradle, <b>APOLLO</b> crew had already established a colonly. The next 9 ships are launched shortly after, with the last <b>AYAT</b> being launched in 4900bu.</p>
	<h1>The Fall/Dark Age.</h1>
	<p>It's direct cause unknown, but with the surviving circumstances being that Earth was already in decline, recovered records from the time period show a dark age during 4900bu to 150bu. here the human population of Cradle (still earth at the time) had decreased from the peak of 15 billion, to less than 500,000. Contact with the Ten had ceased.</p>
	<h1>Post-Fall.</h1>
	<p>After the dark age, a ruined Cradle clings onto hope. The last bits of humanity manage to obtain a breakthrough. A discovery of vaults that were constructed Pre-fall. These vaults contained the knowledge, instructions and  wealth of information that would allow for humanity, at least what was left of it on Cradle, to reconstruct society.</p>
    <h2>The Little Wars.</h2>
	<p>Most records are not properly kept of this period, but accepted archives detail a series of wars that took place around 53bu. These were fueled by the discovery of the vaults, and seem to be a power struggle over the fate of the planet. On a global scale the plannet had to unite.
	<h1>Union.</h1>
	<p>The little wars end, and <b>Union</b> is established throughout Cradle. This is Union's birthplace, and the home of Man-Kind. Although, this union was refered to as ████████████ when Cradle expands, a new form of rule, known as ████████████ █████ █████████ ████ █████████ ████ ████ ██ ██████ ████ █████ █████████  ███████ ██████ ██████ █████ ███████████ ███████ ███████ <b>FOR SECURITY REASONS, SOME INFORMATION ON THIS ARCHIVE IS NOT VIEWABLE AT THIS TIME, THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION,</b> <em>"Union could not bring their dead back home, but they would choke the stars with the living."</em> -UNION'S MISSION.
