          <div class="contentText">
            <p>Untitled is a fan-made website project for Nameless. It is a highly simple website (the one you are reading right now.) that purely serves to document Nameless in a Mini-Wiki format. Nameless has plenty of lore and keeping track of it can be tricky. This website serves as a simple guide to the Nameless world and story, it is not complete and frankly it is a very simple website with not much going on.</p>
			</div>
		    <h1>Why a website?</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>The reason Untitled was made into a website rather than a Notion project is due to both a lack of notetaking and a desire for a more "personal" user experience. Hopefully this will be useful to log sessions, understand lore, and provide context to Nameless as a whole in a <a href="namleg.html">v</a>isual experience.</p> <br>
			<p> A website is able to provide more control, both to the DM and Players as it is an entirely private ordeal, only constrained by a small monthly fee. This in exchange for full control of a whole webpage, leads to be a much better offer than a possible 10-15 dollars a month for useless notetaking apps or overpriced virtual TableTops that only offer a limited selection of features.</p>
