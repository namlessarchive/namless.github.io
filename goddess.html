        	<h1>The Goddess of Light.</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>The Goddess of Light is a self appointed deity, who guides the player characters to their goals. She is self-righteous and comes off to the party a bit dense. She struggles to help with seemingly small scale problems. Emotions are often lost on her.</p>
			<br><p>It is ture however, that she does have the best interest for the PCs in mind. I mean, what else could she want? They are the knights here to save the world from the evil beasts. The party, also dubbed as the Isomer Warriors, is split on their thoughts of her. Perhaps she is just means to an end, or her plans are far more complex than they seem. Either way, though "gracious and glorious" her image beings to tear when put up to test. Below are the current session recaps of Nameless, updated every....uhhhhh</p>
			</div>
			<h1>Session 1.</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>The Isomer Warriors meet the gracious and glorious Goddess of Light, where she gives them their holy mission: Kill the Splendid Beasts, find each key fragment, and cure the Fugue, a disease ravaging humanity. They go to a village, where they spend their time. Namdu and Trenil help a lady find flowers while Taliesin and Silva go to the Ghost's Grave tavern. Trenil and Silva also help the captain of the guard, giving him a letter from his wife. At the end, they all go to the library in hopes they’ll find a lead on where the forlorn are.</p> <br> </div>
			<h1>Session 2.</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>The isomer Warriors head into the library, but are denied any leads by Largo. Figuring they have to prove themselves to him, they go into the village and look for who needs help. They find a decrepit old man in search of his lost dog, whom they assist, only to find out the dog was already dead, with medicinal berries stuck in its mouth. They also help a hunter named Rosemarie, who’s partner has gone missing after an attack by the Forlorn. Trenil and Namdu search the Lost Shrine, where the hunting party’s carriage intitially got attacked, only to find a man claiming to be the “Goddesses Splendid Throat,” while Taliesin and Silva find the lost hunter Sindra, who tried to leave and abandon her comrades.</p> <br> </div>
			<h1>Session 3.</h1>
	      <div class="contentText">
            <p>Trenill goes back to the Eastern Plains to get Sindra's housekey, only to find The Goddess' Splendid Throat. He then goes on to confront the Goddess of Light, finding a recently dissappeared Silva there too. After Trenill returns to the village, he and the rest of the Isomer Warriors go to the Library to tell Largo of their deeds. Though denied by him, Rion comes and gives them a job: help Rosemarie in the Western Plains. The Isomer Warriors find Rosemarie injured and surrounded by the Forlorn. The shadowy enemies are quickly and easily, despite other reports, dispatched. They than return back to the village for their pay.</p> <br> </div>
			<h1>Session 4.</h1>
	      <div class="contentText">
            <p>The Isomer Warriors help Rion investigate a ruined village past the Eastern Plains. On the way, they meet the Goddess' Splendid Throat, who tries to warn the Isomer Warriors of a ruthless murderer named "The Allfather of Flame and Desire." In the ruined village, Trenill murders the Goddess' Splendid Throat, prompting Rion to confront the Isomer Warriors about the Goddess of Light and their ability to use magic. Deeper into the ruined village, they meet a furious yet mysterious woman named Nadia. Namdu and Trenil speak to her, and all seems to be going well until Rion confronts her and Taliesin holds Nadia by knifepoint. Nadia warns the group not to go into a cellar in one of the houses, only for her to be incapacitated by Silva. While Rion tends to Nadia, the Isomer Warriors delve into the hatch, finding a small, mute girl named Lisette. Namdu and Silva leave, while Trenill and Taliesin exchange heartfelt words with the girl. Topside, Namdu and Rion try to resuscitate a fainted Nadia. As each of the Isomer Warrior leave the cellar and Nadia's wounds heal, they all decide to leave the ruined village, swearing to tell no one at the Village of what they saw. Nadia wakes up and has a heartfelt exchange with Taliesin and especially Namdu. Rion, Silva, and Trenill find the Goddess' Splendid Throat to be missing.</p> <br> </div>
