				<h2><a href="index.html">Welcome to Humblewood</a></h2>
				<p>
					This is the main hub/primer for our campaign. Information about the map, races, and the world of Humblewood itself that is relevant to the campaign can all be found on this site.
				</p>
				<p>
					The world of Humblewood, 'Everden' is a vast forest nested between moutains and sea. The forest, called 'The Wood' is where our story will take place. Click below to watch the trailer.

				In the far away world of Everden, on the eastern coast of a great continent, lies a vast forest nestled 
				between the mountains and the sea. This is the Humblewood, an ancient and magical place that hums an endless song, sung to the Great Rhythm of life and death. The Wood, as it is known to its inhabitants, is not like any other forest. The trees are old and powerful, with rare specimens that reach as tall as small mountains. Here familiar beasts grow to unusual sizes, bearing markings and patterns unique to the Wood. This region is also home to two groups of animal-like humanoid races, the <b>birdfolk</b> and the <b>humblefolk</b>. Together they share the Wood and it's bountiful resources.  
			</p>
			<p>
				The Wood is a peaceful, quaint place. Systematically, ruled by the <b>Birdfolk</b> who find their perches quite literally overseeing the abodes. The <b>Humblefolk</b> find their matters attended to however, with representation in council of <b>Alderheart</b>, The Wood's great capital. Yet in the past months, a disturbance has been felt. Trouble emerges from the <b>Scorched Grove</b>, an ashen plain that was ravaged by fire many centuries ago. The grove has expanded, at first slowly but the <b>Tenders</b> (folk magically in-tune with nature), warn of fast approaching flames. A great imbalance of elements, which has caused crop failures, dryness, and forest fires is what threatens The Wood. Forest dwellers have been left without homes thus turning to banditry. This chaos cannot proceed! It is up to you to find what is burning Humblewood and to stop it!
			</p>
			<p>
				It is encouraged that your characters are born and raised in The Wood, but not necessary, you may chose to be from any of the locations on the <b>Map</b>. Regardless, you should come up with a concept prior to session 0, and have a race and class in mind, or come with a completed sheet. Backstories don't need to be long, but should provide a reason for your character to want save The Wood. For example:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Perhaps it is their lifelong home with family and friends they must protect.</li>
				<li>Or their hamlet was attacked by fire elemental spawns and they were forced to move.</li>
				<li>Perhaps they feel dealing with the growing bandit collation is best done by eliminating the source.</li>
				<li>Or maybe they just don't want their favorite poop perch to burn down.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				It can be entirely up to you, however their is one element that will be discussed further in session 0 that I'd like you to keep open for in your backstories. It is highly encouraged that prior to the events of the campaign your character know at least <b>one</b> other party member's character. This can be a variety of relationships, siblings, cousins, classmates, old-rivals or just friendly neighbors. Again, up to you, but highly encouraged.
