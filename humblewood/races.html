						<h2>The Birdfolk</h2>

							<p>
								The birdfolk races of Humblewood are as diverse and unique as the forest itself. Only the skillful survive the forest, and the birdfolk have become masters of both the forest floor and the canopies above, creating several settlements (known colloquially as “perches”) throughout the Wood.
							</p>
							<p>
								Corvums are a crow-like race with dark feathers and sharp 
								minds. Their reputation in birdfolk society is nothing short 
								of villainous, and they are regularly cast as the antagonists of 
								any given situation.
							</p>
							<p>
								The gallus commonly dwell in small, familial communities as opposed to the grand perches of the Wood. Of the birdfolk, they are the most likely to be found living among the humblefolk. Gallus have a deep respect for nature and a love of gardening unmatched by other birdfolk. They value their social bonds above all else, and are always ready to help their neighbours and promote the common good. They are polite but have little patience for deceit and rudeness
							</p>
							<p>
								Lumas are a race of polar opposites when it comes to their role in perch society. They are as often shunned for their eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colours, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.
							</p>
							<p>
								When the birdfolk think of hunters or rangers, they picture a raptor. Resembling small hawks, eagles, and other birds of prey, they have sharp talons and agile builds that help them effortlessly glide through the canopy. These birdfolk are swift and strong with an uncanny knack for tracking. They are rarely prey, and are quick to turn the tables when finding themselves hunted.
							</p>
							<p>
								Strigs are the most imposing of the birdfolk races. Resembling owls, their thick feathers, solid bodies, and broad wings have earned them a reputation as the most powerful of the birdfolk races. They value strength and endurance, traits they believe crucial for survival in the Wood.

						<h2>The Humblefolk</h2>
					</li>
				</ul>

						<p>
							Not all denizens of Humblewood are birdfolk. The term “humblefolk” is used throughout the Wood to refer to the non-birdfolk peoples who live a little closer to the forest floor. Unlike the birdfolk, whose shared language, histories, myths, and culture have allowed them to exist in harmony for most of Humblewood's history, the humblefolk represent a disparate group of peoples, cultures, and ways of seeing the world, many of whom haven't always seen eye to eye.
						</p>
						<p>
							Cervans are a versatile deer-like folk who make their homes in small, intimate villages throughout Humblewood. More insular than other humblefolk, cervans often reside deep in the most ancient parts of the vast forest, in tree stands and groves far from birdfolk perches.
						</p>
						<p>
							The most diplomatic and good natured of all the humblefolk, hedges like to live quiet lives in villages throughout the Wood, or within the safety of birdfolk perches. They resemble hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures.
						</p>
						<p>
							Jerbeens are small mouse-like folk with long, furred tails that help them balance. In proportion to the rest of their body, a jerbeen's legs are long and powerful. Jerbeens can be found in a variety of places across the Wood.
						</p>
						<p>
							Naturally curious, mapachs are a medium-sized racoon-like race. They are crafty, hearty, and tough, but their true strength lies in the potential they see when looking at the world around them. Mapachs have incredibly light hands and a great degree of fine motor control that doesn't diminish with age.
						</p>
						<p>
							Vulpins are fox-like in appearance, with light builds and sharp fangs. One of the least understood and most often vilified humblefolk in the Wood, vulpins have earned a bad reputation that isn't entirely deserved. Much of this stems from the fact that vulpins are ambitious.
